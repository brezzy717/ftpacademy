You are building a FULLY FUNCTIONAL Webflow website AND attached web application for a private post-secondary e-learning academy. Do NOT limit this to UI mockups only. Use Webflow’s capabilities to the fullest: CMS collections, Memberships, Logic, forms, gated content, and any features available to implement real data structures, user accounts, course areas, and dashboards.

You are designing a modern, responsive marketing website and e-learning application for a private post-secondary certification school called:

Name: First Thought Project Academy  
Short name: FTP Academy  
Domain: https://www.ftp.academy  
Location: Arizona (serving all 50 U.S. states via distance learning)

MISSION & POSITIONING  
FTP Academy is a career-readiness and private post-secondary education provider focused on high-demand, skills-based certification programs. We blend live instruction, pre-recorded modules, hands-on training, and job placement support. We work with students who are:  
\- WIOA / Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act eligible  
\- Justice-impacted / re-entry  
\- Veterans  
\- Under-employed or seeking a career change  
\- Motivated to start their own small business after certification

We partner with workforce programs and Fortune 500 employers to create clear, real-world career pathways.

PROJECT OVERVIEW  
FTP Academy is a career-readiness and private post-secondary school that offers certification programs with live and pre-recorded courses, quizzes, hands-on components, and job placement support. We serve WIOA-eligible students, justice-impacted individuals, veterans, under-employed adults, and career changers who may be nervous about going “back to school” but are serious about changing their lives and often motivated to start their own small business after certification.

We need:  
1\. A public-facing marketing website.  
2\. A secured e-learning web application with:  
   \- Authentication & role-based access (students, staff/admins).  
   \- Course areas with modules, lessons, PDFs, quizzes.  
   \- Progress tracking.  
   \- Space to integrate a course-specific AI tutor per program later.

This SHOULD be designed as a full-stack Webflow application using its native tools, ready to run in production (not just “ready to plug into a backend later”).

PART 2 – AUTH / MEMBERSHIP & ROLES

Use Webflow Memberships (or the current built-in auth system) to create real authentication and gated content.

MEMBERSHIP ROLES (OR EQUIVALENT ROLE LOGIC)  
\- Role: Student  
  \- Can access: Student Dashboard, “My Courses,” course content, quizzes.  
\- Role: Staff (Instructor)  
  \- Can access: Staff/Instructor Dashboard, limited student/course views.  
\- Role: Admin  
  \- Can access: Admin Dashboard with broader overview and management UIs.

Set up:  
\- Sign up flow (tied to admissions or manually created accounts for now).  
\- Login page(s) for Students and Staff/Admin.  
\- Protect course and dashboard pages behind login with correct role gating.

PAGES:

1\) Login Page (Students)  
\- Email \+ password fields.  
\- Links: “Forgot password?” and “Need to apply first?”

2\) Login Page (Staff/Admin)  
\- Separate or shared login with clear labels for staff/admin access.

PART 3 – STUDENT PORTAL / E-LEARNING APP

Create a Student Portal as a functional application experience, using real Webflow structure (CMS \+ Memberships \+ Logic).

A) Student Dashboard (Gated to Students)  
Elements:  
\- Welcome banner: “Welcome, \[Student Name\]”  
\- “Current Program” card with:  
  \- Program name  
  \- Overall progress bar  
  \- Next upcoming live session (date/time)  
  \- Button: “Go to Course”  
\- “My Courses” section (if multiple programs):  
  \- Cards with:  
    \- Course title  
    \- Progress bar (% complete)  
    \- Next upcoming live session  
    \- “Continue” CTA  
\- “Announcements” panel:  
  \- CMS collection “Announcements” for school-wide updates and schedule changes.  
\- “Upcoming Sessions” mini-calendar:  
  \- List of next live classes, labs, Q\&A sessions, drawing from a CMS “Sessions” collection (with date/time, program, type).  
\- “Resources & Downloads”:  
  \- Links to student handbook, tech support, career services, etc.  
\- Status section (text-only values for now) for:  
  \- Laptop shipped (Yes/No/TBD)  
  \- Exam voucher issued (Yes/No)  
  \- $250 Visa gift card issued (Yes/No)

B) Course Content Structure (CMS)  
Create CMS collections to support modular curriculum:

\- Collection: Programs  
\- Collection: Modules  
  \- Fields: Name, Description, Program (reference to Programs), Order, Estimated duration.  
\- Collection: Lessons  
  \- Fields: Name, Description, Module (reference), Video URL/Embed, PDF downloads (files), Lesson order, “Has quiz?” toggle.  
\- Collection: Quizzes  
  \- Fields: Linked Lesson (reference), Title, Instructions, Question set (rich text or multi-reference to a “Questions” collection with question/answer data).  
\- Optional: Collection “Resources” for additional course materials linked to Programs or Modules.

C) “My Course” Page (Per Program for the Student)  
Template-like layout a logged-in student sees when they click into a course:

\- Header:  
  \- Course name, brief description, current overall progress bar.  
\- Sections:  
  \- Modules list:  
    \- Each module with name, short description, progress indicator (e.g., “3/7 lessons complete”).  
  \- “Continue where you left off” button.  
\- Tabs or segments for:  
  \- Overview  
  \- Modules / Lessons  
  \- Resources & Downloads  
  \- Grades / Assessments

D) Lesson View Page  
For each Lesson (CMS-based):

\- Main content area:  
  \- Lesson title  
  \- Embedded video using Video URL field  
  \- Short description  
\- Sidebar / navigation:  
  \- List of lessons in the current module with indicators (Not Started / In Progress / Complete).  
\- Download links:  
  \- Attach and display PDFs, workbook, slides from the Lesson’s file fields.  
\- “Key takeaways” / notes section.  
\- Quiz/assessment area:  
  \- If the lesson’s “Has quiz?” toggle is true, show a “Take Quiz” button or embedded quiz preview.  
\- “Mark Lesson Complete” button:  
  \- Implement using Webflow Logic, forms, or a progress mechanism that can later tie into a more advanced backend if needed.

E) Quiz / Assessment Page  
Create a generic quiz template:

\- Show:  
  \- Quiz title  
  \- Instructions  
\- Render questions from CMS:  
  \- Either as rich text or using a related “Questions” collection.  
\- Inputs:  
  \- Multiple-choice, true/false, or short answer fields.  
\- Buttons:  
  \- “Save & Continue”  
  \- “Submit Quiz”  
\- After submission:  
  \- Show a simple confirmation (“Quiz submitted”) and placeholder for score/result display. This can later be extended with more advanced grading logic.

PART 4 – AI COURSE TUTOR PLACEHOLDER

We are not asking you to implement an actual AI backend here, but we DO want a UI container designed in the lesson view where a course-specific AI tutor will live.

In each Lesson View page:  
\- Include a slide-out or docked panel labeled “Course AI Tutor.”  
\- Inside this panel:  
  \- Chat-style area for messages (student question \+ response).  
  \- Input box and “Ask” button.  
  \- Helper prompt buttons such as:  
    \- “Explain this concept in simpler terms”  
    \- “Create a practice problem for me”  
    \- “Quiz me on this module”  
    \- “Summarize this lesson”  
Design this so it can later host an embedded custom script or third-party widget. This tutor is specific to the course content and should be visually indicated as using only that course’s curriculum.

PART 5 – STAFF / ADMIN DASHBOARDS

Create separate dashboards gated by membership roles.

A) Staff Dashboard (Instructors)  
\- Show:  
  \- Assigned programs/courses.  
  \- Calendar or list of upcoming live sessions they are teaching.  
  \- List of students in their cohorts (view-only table: name, email, status).  
  \- Quick links to view Modules and Lessons for the courses they teach.  
\- This is primarily a teaching/oversight view, not full admin control.

B) Admin Dashboard  
\- KPI cards:  
  \- Total active students  
  \- Students per program  
  \- Number of active cohorts  
  \- Nearest upcoming start dates  
\- Navigation for:  
  \- Students  
  \- Programs  
  \- Modules & Lessons  
  \- Quizzes & Assessments  
  \- Announcements  
\- “Students” view:  
  \- Table with Name, Email, Program, Cohort, Status (Active/Completed/On Hold), and a link to view profile.  
\- “Content” view:  
  \- Interface to view/edit Programs, Modules, Lessons (leveraging Webflow CMS editing experience, but surfaced in an admin-style layout).  
\- “Announcements” management:  
  \- Create/edit announcements for the Student Dashboard.

PART 6 – RESPONSIVE & ACCESSIBLE DESIGN

\- All pages must be fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile.  
\- Navigation should collapse into a clean mobile menu on smaller screens.  
\- Dashboards should stack vertically in a readable format on mobile.  
\- Use high-contrast colors, large legible fonts, clear focus states, and keyboard-accessible buttons and links.

PRIMARY CALLS-TO-ACTION (GLOBAL)  
Across the marketing site, emphasize:  
\- “Apply Now”  
\- “Talk to Admissions”  
\- “View Program Details”

SUMMARY  
Build a cohesive, production-ready Webflow project that includes:  
\- A public marketing site for FTP Academy with all pages and sections described above.  
\- Real authentication with membership roles (Student, Staff, Admin).  
\- A Student Portal with dashboards, courses, modules, lessons, quizzes, and an AI-tutor UI placeholder.  
\- Staff and Admin dashboards for oversight and content management.  
\- CMS collections for programs, modules, lessons, quizzes, announcements, testimonials, staff, FAQs, and any needed resources.  
Use Webflow’s native tools (CMS, Memberships, Logic, forms, gated content, etc.) wherever possible to make this a real, functional, full-stack e-learning web application rather than just static layouts.
