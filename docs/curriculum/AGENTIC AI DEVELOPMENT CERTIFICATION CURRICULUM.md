# **Certification Program Curricula – Agentic AI Development**

# **Program 1: Agentic AI Application Development & Generative AI**

**Overview:** This intensive 4–6 month program trains students in **AI application development** with a focus on **agentic AI and generative AI**. It covers machine learning fundamentals, building AI-driven applications, and integrating large language models (LLMs) into real-world solutions. The curriculum is designed for beginners (with basic tech aptitude) and progresses to advanced concepts. Two tracks are offered: a **Foundational Track** (approx. 3 months, \~$6,500) covering core basics, and an **Advanced Track** (approx. 6 months, \~$12,000) that includes extended modules and a capstone project. Graduates will be prepared for roles as junior AI developers or prompt engineers, and the content aligns with industry certifications (e.g. Google TensorFlow Developer, AWS Machine Learning Specialty, etc.) for added credibility.

**Program Structure & Delivery:**

*An AI-driven virtual instructor leads interactive classes, blending live lectures with hands-on coding labs.*

Classes run 2–3 hours per day, 5 days a week, combining **instructor-led lessons** with guided practice. Instruction is delivered via a **virtual AI instructor avatar** in a live online classroom, providing engaging lectures and demos. Students receive a comprehensive digital **workbook** (PDF format) that complements each module – containing notes, diagrams, exercises, and room for personal notes. The workbook serves as a reference guide throughout the course and beyond. Each module includes formative **quizzes** to reinforce learning, and there are regular assignments where students incrementally build parts of an AI application. The **learning model** is project-based: as new topics are covered, students implement those features in their ongoing project. By the end of the program, each student has built a functioning AI-driven application step-by-step. Support is provided through an online forum and weekly live Q\&A sessions with instructors. This program structure is designed to meet Arizona state post-secondary education standards and ACCET accreditation requirements for instructional hours and outcomes.

**Curriculum Modules & Topics:** The following modules make up the advanced program (the foundational track covers a subset of Modules 1–6). Each module is approximately 1–3 weeks long, featuring both theory and applied labs:

* **Module 1: Introduction to AI and Machine Learning** – Definition of AI, history and industry trends, overview of machine learning vs. traditional programming. Students learn key concepts (models, training, inference) and explore basic **Python** programming (if needed) and tools. This module also covers ethical considerations and real-world applications of AI.

* **Module 2: Programming Foundations for AI (Python & Tools)** – Core Python skills for AI development, including data structures, libraries (NumPy, pandas), and environment setup (IDE, notebooks). Introduction to **software development workflows** (version control with Git). Students build simple Python programs to solidify coding skills needed for later modules.

* **Module 3: Data Management and Big Data Basics** – Understanding data collection, datasets, and database integration. Concepts of **big data** and data pipelines are introduced. Students practice loading, cleaning, and visualizing data. They also learn to set up and use databases (SQL/NoSQL) relevant to AI applications for storing and retrieving data. Basic **ETL pipelines** (extract, transform, load) and tools for data workflow automation are covered.

* **Module 4: Machine Learning Fundamentals** – Key algorithms in supervised learning (regression, classification) and unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction). Students get hands-on with frameworks like **scikit-learn** to train simple models (e.g. a linear regression and a decision tree classifier). Emphasis is on understanding model evaluation, performance metrics, and iterative improvement. This module provides the background equivalent to an “Intro to Machine Learning” course, ensuring students grasp how models learn from data.

* **Module 5: Deep Learning & Neural Networks** – Introduction to neural networks and deep learning. Students learn the basics of neural network architecture, activation functions, training (gradient descent), and evaluation. Using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, they build and train a basic neural network (e.g. for image recognition or sentiment analysis). This segment aligns with topics from the TensorFlow Developer Certification, giving exposure to building and deploying models in TensorFlow.

* **Module 6: Generative AI and LLMs** – Focus on generative models with an emphasis on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. The theory of transformers and model fine-tuning is covered in an accessible way. Students experiment with pre-built APIs (such as OpenAI’s GPT or open-source alternatives) to generate text and images, and learn prompt engineering techniques. Key generative AI concepts (like diffusion models for image generation and sequence-to-sequence models for text) are introduced. The module also discusses responsible use of generative AI and avoiding biases.

* **Module 7: Agentic AI Development** – Students learn how to build **AI agents** that can autonomously interact with software tools and data. This includes using frameworks (like LangChain or Microsoft’s guidance) to create agents that call APIs, process user requests, and perform tasks. A highlight is learning about **Model Context Protocols (MCPs)** – a new standard that acts as a *“bridge between AI and real-world systems”* , enabling LLM-based agents to access external tools and data securely. Students practice integrating an LLM with an MCP server or similar tool, so their AI agent can, for example, retrieve information from a database or call an external API. This cutting-edge topic ensures students are up to date on the latest AI integration techniques .

* **Module 8: SDKs, APIs, and Cloud Integration** – This module teaches how to work with various **Software Development Kits (SDKs)** and APIs for AI services. Students learn to use cloud-based AI services (with an emphasis on **Azure**, given its prominence) – for example, Azure Cognitive Services or AWS AI services – and how to authenticate and call these APIs from their applications. They also get exposure to using **MCP SDKs** and other AI toolkits to extend their agent’s capabilities. The concept of containerization (using Docker) might be introduced to show how to deploy AI applications consistently.

* **Module 9: Workflow Automation and Orchestration** – Introduction to automating ML workflows. Students explore **N8N** (a popular open-source workflow automation tool) to connect various services and build AI-driven workflows without heavy coding. For instance, an exercise could be setting up an N8N workflow that triggers an AI model when new data arrives, or integrates their AI agent into a larger business process. This gives students insight into low-code integration and how AI can be plugged into real business pipelines.

* **Module 10: “Vibe Coding” and AI-Assisted Development** – A look at the emerging practice of *“vibe coding”*, where developers use AI co-pilots to generate and refine code . Students practice using AI pair-programming tools (such as GitHub Copilot, Replit Ghostwriter, or ChatGPT’s coding assistant) to speed up development. The course emphasizes a **“code first, refine later”** approach, encouraging rapid prototyping with AI assistance . This module also reinforces best practices: having a human in the loop for reviewing AI-generated code to ensure quality and security. By experiencing vibe coding, students learn to leverage AI to enhance their productivity and creativity in development.

* **Module 11: Security, Testing & Deployment** – Cross-cutting issues for any production application. Students learn basics of **application security**, including how to secure AI systems (protecting API keys, data privacy, and mitigating vulnerabilities such as prompt injection in LLMs). They also cover software testing fundamentals (unit tests for their Python code and testing AI components for correctness). Finally, the module covers deployment strategies: how to deploy their AI application to the cloud (e.g. deploying a web app or a backend service on Azure/AWS) and setting up CI/CD pipelines for ongoing development. This ensures that in addition to building smart apps, students can ship them in a reliable and secure manner.

* **Module 12: Capstone Project Development** – Throughout the program, students have been incrementally building an AI-driven application of their choice (with instructor guidance to ensure scope is manageable). In the final weeks, they focus on completing this **capstone project**. This includes integrating all pieces they built in earlier modules, refining the user interface or experience, and ensuring the agent or ML components work end-to-end. Example capstones could be a custom chatbot that assists in a specific task (finance, marketing, etc.), a generative AI web app, or an AI tool that integrates with external APIs to perform automated tasks. Students document their project and prepare a brief presentation/demo.

**Assessments & Certification Alignment:** Each module ends with a short **quiz** or assignment to test knowledge. In addition, there are at least 3 major **checkpoint projects** (at the end of fundamental sections) where students must apply concepts in a practical task – for example, building and evaluating a small ML model (after Module 4), or creating a basic LLM chatbot (after Module 6). These projects ensure students can integrate what they learned. At course completion, students take a comprehensive **final exam** covering all major theoretical concepts and practical skills taught. The final exam includes both a written component (e.g. multiple-choice and short-answer questions on key concepts) and a hands-on component (fixing or completing a short piece of AI code). Students also must **present their capstone project** (live demo and Q\&A) as part of their final assessment.

Upon successful completion, graduates receive a **Certificate in Agentic AI Application Development** from our WIOA-approved school. The curriculum is mapped to skills measured in several industry certifications, enabling students to pursue those if desired. For instance, the coverage of neural networks and TensorFlow in Module 5–6 helps prepare for Google’s TensorFlow Developer Certificate, and the cloud integration in Module 8 aligns with knowledge areas of AWS’s Machine Learning Specialty exam. The program also touches on content from **CompTIA Data+ and Cloud+** (data management, cloud concepts) and introduces **Microsoft’s Azure AI services**, giving students a well-rounded foundation. While not an official prep course for those external certifications, our program ensures students **meet or exceed current industry standards** in AI development skills.

Finally, the inclusion of cutting-edge topics (like MCP integrations and vibe coding) makes this program truly state-of-the-art. Graduates will not only understand the *fundamentals* of machine learning and AI, but also be capable of leveraging the *latest tools and methodologies* in generative AI development – positioning them to be innovative developers in this fast-evolving field.

They don't run with the pack, they lead it. It's proof that they have an enterprise-grade comprehensive understanding of web development and agentic AI providing them an edge in the application process to any of the top-ranked companies. Or even the skills necessary to start their own agency. Not only will you understand the fundamentals but how to apply them, create real, tangible products, and leverage your results.

71% of all new jobs in STEM are in computing. Computer science majors can earn up to 40% more than the average college student. Programming jobs are expected to project a growth rate of 2x of all other jobs in the country.

We inspire and motivate, we have a superior curriculum quality, literally spending hundreds of hours working with experts at the top of their field so that students are learning from the most reliable sources possible. We want our students to develop a genuine passion for programming and agentic AI, so we select course materials, rich and invigorating, never boring or dull. We utilize analogy-driven learning, teaching complex information very simply without dumbing it down. That way, students get the full learning experience without all the frustration.

We have taken the superior curriculum quality and coupled that with the top agentic embeddings so that our curriculum comes through with the best possible teacher you could ever have, and that is… an actual coding model, top-tier in its space, teaching from its point of view on how to properly lint, select, find, isolate, and fix any error you could possibly imagine on any line of code. How to build it properly the first time so it just works. Tools, tips, and tricks on how to get you there from ground zero to fully fledged SAS.

And then we have our teachers take over implementing the business portion section of the curriculum where we mold everything that we've taught together into one cohesive section showing them how to not only leverage what they've learned but to accurately price their new skill set in the market to make themselves confident enough to understand that they are worth their asking price and they will get it.

We provide the correct pacing for our students. Nothing too fast and nothing too slow. We're actually just right in the middle. We've spent a lot of time understanding how to maximize engagement. We typically utilize A/B split-tested curriculum to ensure that our students learn the right way and have the most efficient learning experience possible. We've actually invested pretty heavily in the curriculum we teach. Developing this entire module was an intricate 100-hour process just to make sure everything was completed with the immaculate level of accuracy.

We also made this a project-based learning curriculum where we pick the right projects enforcing engagement and key concepts so students can both enjoy being the master or can both master and enjoy the coding experience, the agentic experience, the web development experience. All of these things are so important and they all go hand-in-hand. Knowing something about everything not only makes you the renaissance man in the group but it also makes you dangerous and incredibly sought-after, especially when you take all those skills, hone on them, and then excel in an area that nobody else is in. We also teach outside the box in critical thinking skills \- how to look at a problem and solve it 8 different ways before committing to paper. Optimizing your best route forward and understanding the best way to your most favorable outcome.

Our goal is to take you from a beginner to even an intermediate or advanced programmer within 4 months. You're learning real code, building real enterprise-grade websites and SAS products from an agency standpoint without taking any shortcuts. You're receiving a certification and award that can be used to land prestigious jobs anywhere you go in the country.

The director of our academy has taught me how important it is to know what's in the curriculum and what and how we teach it so that our graduates are top-tier with a top-tier education. She knows how important it is to come correct with the right skill set in this day and age. You will never have to take another web development class ever, it's that comprehensive.

When this course is finished, you'll be able to build anything from the ground up and be hella proud of it\! Along with web development and agentic AI, the third piece of the puzzle is software development. You learn to code properly. In all programming languages that are essential skills and credentials that you will need to advance your studies in software design, development programs, and information technology as a whole.

This course teaches the same software programming language used to build companies like Facebook, Yahoo, and WordPress. You're going to learn syntax and problem-solving skills, but most importantly, you learn to pull it all together by programming an MVP of your chosen big name company and the back-end software that powers it. This is what we leverage that problem-solving logic and critical thinking to gain an edge. We're developing full skill sets here, not just specializations. It's a complete, all-in-one PHP/MySQL software development course. This is direct experience with problem-solving, coming up with solutions using syntax, and utilizing all the most important concepts that you have to know in order to be self-sufficient in any application. So many students right now are taking programming classes, but have no idea how to actually code anything because there's a big difference between being able to understand the definition of what something is versus being able to use it to create something functional. Unfortunately, most will receive an incomplete understanding of the language from other programs because they're never taught how to use it to build something actionable and engaging. No matter where you are in life, you're going to need to utilize problem-solving and critical thinking. Those skills need to be practiced, honed, and challenged in order to grow. We exercise that part of the brain heavily and make sure our students leave class as a better problem solver with more critical and creative thinking skills based on fact and how they solve real problems in programming.

Our course is a one-stop shop. Students who complete it will be completely self-sufficient in all important concepts of PHP and MySQL, agentic AI, web development fundamentals, advanced concepts, syntax, and more. You will have left this class building your own end-to-end web application utilizing agentic AI and web development skills. These are truly practical, valuable, and marketable skill sets that you'll rely on for the rest of your life.

Our software development course gives you a foundational knowledge of key programming languages, software engineering basics, and practical coding experience. Whether you're a brand new developer or you want to improve your skills, this programming course offers a clear curriculum. Learn popular languages like Java, SQL, Python, Ruby on Rails, and other web development tools such as React Native and APIs, along with agentic AI, databases, data pipelines, how to correctly set up hosting environments, we teach you about Docker. Automations like cron job and 8n, in a jest, we teach you how to build out your own locally hosted AI large-language model trained on your knowledge base and your knowledge set and fine-tuned to your degree. We give you fundamentals and best coding practices with detailed software development curriculum based on SDLC. You have a full training in object-oriented design, algorithms, and problem-solving. We expose you to cloud computing and current development tools and a certification to prove your skills to employers.

Knowing core programming languages is important when starting in software development. This section introduces basic programming concepts taught in our software development and software engineering courses. They learn structured programming and key fundamentals with languages like Java, SQL, and JavaScript.

The program languages support many software developer roles in front-end, back-end, and full stack development, along with UX, AI, UI, web dev, and agentic toolkits to further their skills in practical coding and software design basics.

Not only do we give clear explanations in every section, but we also make sure to introduce hands-on exercises to build critical thinking skills, logic, and problem-solving. So that we can then bring it all together in a cohesive, incredibly thorough, proprietary curriculum. Nobody else has. They may teach the same stuff, but they're not teaching it the same way, and that makes a big difference.

During our onboarding experience, when you meet with one of our counselors to go over the curriculum, we find out about you, how you learn best, what works for you and what doesn't. We literally map everything about you so that this curriculum fits you to a T. We don't want you to mold to IT. We're going to mold it to YOU. That way, it's something malleable that you can take with you through the rest of your life and impress it upon any other area necessary. And that's huge.

Our whole lives, everyone's always been trying to tell us to fit into a mold that didn't work for us, that couldn't hold our skill set, that didn't encompass every part of us, and that was a mistake. Not everyone was made the same on purpose, so we show you how to leverage and exploit your amazing talents, not hide them and hunker them into a mold that doesn't fit you. Our sources for curriculum come from:

 • IEEE Computer Society Software Engineering Body of Knowledge
