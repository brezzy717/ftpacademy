**FIRST THOUGHT PROJECT ACADEMY**

**CERTIFICATION PROGRAM VIA DISTANCE LEARNING**

My entire reason for starting a certification program with a few different courses that serve as the distance learning community was because initially I had heard of the WIOA grant and funding programs that essentially paid tuition for certain individuals if they were approved. Because it is funded by the federal government and is given to the Department of Economic Security to dole out. Typically speaking, they center in on and focus on justice-impacted individuals, those at the poverty line, and even people out of rehab like I said, prisons or jail, veterans. Essentially anyone seeking a change in their life and they're not sure how to get there and don't really have the means to do so. This gives them a leg up where they really need the help to put a different tool in their tool chest. And I love that idea. So rather than people having to go out and dig themselves into a hole of debt with traditional student loans and Title 5 funding, they have the option of applying for this WIOA grant through their state. And I believe depending on the certification program, it provides anywhere between $7,000 and $15,000 of tuition payment on their behalf to the chosen school per student. 

**SCHOOL SET UP & WIOA GRANTS**

In order to complete steps one through five below, you're going to have to go ahead and make sure you've got everything in place, such as:

* A name picked out for your entity  
* An address  
* Designated phone number  
* I got a fax line as well  
* Snatch up your domain  
* Set up your business email for that domain as well

*Now in order to become an authorized and approved curriculum course provider, there's a million in one hoops you have to jump through.* 

1. Get yourself set up properly with your secretary of state so you can be an actual company (LLC, corporation, nonprofit, for-profit doesn't matter).   
2. Then you have to get (this is gonna be different everywhere), but for me it was a $15,000 bond which cost me around $250.   
3. You also have to get your basic indemnity agreement signed and you have to have general liability insurance (again, no big deal).   
4. Oversight (at least in Arizona anyway), is with Arizona Private Post-Secondary Education and they charge you about $2,250 for the initial application and then an ongoing renewal fee of somewhere between $500 to a thousand dollars depending on how much you collect every year in tuition.   
5. Finally, accreditation. Get yourself accredited through a reputable agency such as SORA (there's many many of them and it's gonna all depend on what you offer class or course wise). So for myself, obviously, I went for SORA because they are top tier for distance learning programs. That is another $2,000 or so.

Now at this point, you can go ahead and reach out to your local WIOA granting agency and apply to become an approved certification offering provider. They're going to have their own steps that you will need to complete, which involves taking all of the documents you've received above for accreditation, oversight, the bond, insurance, as well as your specific curriculum documentation and a few other outlier documents you must create that pertain to how your school is run, how the programs are taught, graded student academic specifics, and so on and so forth. You'll get all of those things together, submit them, and then you will have to wait until you get the go-ahead. But typically speaking, it'll take you about a year start to finish to get all of these things in place. ***(And yes, that is exactly where I'm at. All of those things are in place, curriculum is completed, and now I need to go ahead and create my e-learning platform.)***

**CHOOSING CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS YOU WILL OFFER**

Then, once you have the basics set up, figure out what you are going to offer for courses and curriculum (i.e., which programs your school will offer for certification to your students). The best and smartest way to do this is to go ahead and hop on something like ChatGPT, have them do some deep research in your area specifically with a forward-looking breakdown over the next five years for the top growth industries. The things that are going to stay relevant that continue to climb where we need people. Of course, it has to have something like "technician" at the end of the name (i.e., web development technician, veterinary technician, HVAC technician, welding tech, heavy mechanic, or heavy machinery mechanical technician). CNAs, CDL licensing, and so on and so forth. Pick out between one and three certification offerings that you believe will do the best numbers in your area based on this research. You're going to also want to price out typical certification programs \- what their cost is and roughly how long it will take to graduate students enrolled in that course. Which means you're going to have to map out modules, quizzing, testing, all that good stuff.

At this point, you're going to need to decide to either develop your own curriculum or find someone who is selling what you need that you can then white label for your own company/institution. Depending on the curriculum that you're offering for certification, you must make sure it aligns with industry standards. If there are no typical industry standards, set them yourself by doing your due diligence, going around checking out different programs, seeing what they offer, figuring out the top-tier skill sets necessary that are the key money makers \- the ones that people must have and the ones that employers are looking for in those industries. To compile them into a well-rounded, 360-degree, complete offering that puts your graduates' heads and shoulders above the rest \- the skills of tomorrow, not yesterday.

Once you get your curriculum all set up (like for me, I went ahead and created my own). I offer two programs, and a third is in the works. 

1. HVAC  
2. Agentic Development and Machine Learning  
3. CDL (coming soon)

**WHAT SETS YOUR SCHOOL/PROGRAMS APART FROM THE REST**

We specifically pride ourselves on working with entities like the Arizona Department of Economic Security via the Workforce Development Opportunity Act to provide opportunities to those who are just as impacted, veterans, or those who may be struggling but want to make a change and need additional resources to put into their tool belt. We'll work with you as much as we can. We are based out of Arizona but offer distance learning in any of the 50 states. Another cool thing in the works is our budding relationship with the justice programs including adult probation, AZDOC, Maricopa and Pinal County Jails, individual municipal court programs offering program completion instead of jail time, and even the superior court in some instances offering the same in loo of confinement. We are also establishing specific program availability for those exiting drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers looking to make a concerted and incredible change in the lives of not only them but their families by providing them a means to accomplish and acquire a skillset that will ensure they remain employable and a contributing and functional member of our communities. We even have special offerings for military Vets and their immediate family members. Our goal is to have a transitional housing community built and doors open for the folks exiting confinement or rehabilitation centers so that they not only have a roof over their heads and provided meals but also that sense of a support community of like minded peers all working towards the same goal while attending one our certification programs by quarter 4 of 2026 into quarter 1 of 2027\. This program will be 100% paid for via angel investors, our CEO and grants from state and federal governments. Our non profit sister company will be heading up that side of things but its an exciting new path we are embarking on in the coming year.

Every student who enrolls into one of our Certification Programs will be provided with all the tools needed for success. This includes: A brand new HP Laptop stocked full of all the programs needed to make their studies smooth (MS Office, Google Workspace, Adobe, Chat GPT, Pomodoro Time Tracking, Task and Productivity Apps and so much more) naturally the laptop will come with accessories (i.e. power cord, a pair of wireless headphones, and protective sleeve). Student ID's are distributed along with branded school gear (i.e. sweatshirt, tshirt, snapback, lanyard, waterbottle and course/day planner), an assortment of pens, notebooks, database/LLM credits and a voucher for any required testing after graduation for specialty items such as with HVAC and CDL. We also give students a $250 visa gift card upon the commencement of classes to help supplement any meals or gas or whatever the student deems necessary to help them along. )

**E LEARNING PLATFORM**

This is key, and this is huge. You are going to either need to sign up with a provider that already offers what you need (just FYI, these get pricey) or you can go ahead and attempt to build one custom to you with all of the new tools they have for coding and agentics now. It is extremely possible, whereas before it was very difficult to go this route. However, this is the route I am absolutely going with is building out my own e-learning platform that is going to have everything below:

I am creating an E Learning platform for my WIOA provider an accredited (SORA) distance learning certification academy (oversight is via AZ Private Postsecondary Education) where we offer the following courses: 

1. Agentic Development and Machine Learning (20Wks- $14,250)  
2. HVAC (24Wks- $12,500)   
3. Soon To Be- CDL (12Wks- $7,220)

I need to create the E Learning Platform for the 1\. Course Curriculum and User Dashboards, 2\. Admin Dashboard, and 3\. The Marketing website landing page and course offering pages. The Student/User Course Dashboards houses all courses and modules, the docs, quizzes, and an AI Tutor with course specific knowledge base that will live in the students dashboard as a universal always on widget accessible by text chat feature and voice natural language chat functionality...the dashboards will be attached to the marketing website via a “STUDENT LOGIN” feature at the top right of the website with user authentication and role level security that takes you to the backend webapp. The school’s site itself will explore the different courses offered, detailed module and training information, admissions and tuition info with WIOA Grant specifics and other in house tuition payment options available. These Career Readiness Certification Programs are top notch and we also offer job placement assistance after graduation with a number of incredible corporations along with an entrepreneur specific training segment for those wanting to go into business for themselves- we show you how to set up your own entity, explain tax benefits and payroll, help you get started with marketing and even building business credit for when you need to expand and seek out funding opportunities. 

The e-learning platform is home to certification courses with both live and pre-recorded lessons and modules, accompanied by follow along PDF documents for optimized note taking, one click study guides and flash cards, quizzes and grading rubrics. We also offer our custom curated knowledge based AI Tutor with a wide array of skills to enhance your education experience for on demand answers, definitions, best practices and even provides you with an in depth explainer of topics you may need to explore further. With voice capability, doc creation and more you can have your GPT Tutor quiz you on the fly or create custom study guides to fit your style.

It is imperative that the curriculum be easily updated and changed out via upload or embedding. Most of it is live and video pre-recorded. There are several different modules under each course, there's also testing and hands-on segments that must be accounted for and have its designated place.
